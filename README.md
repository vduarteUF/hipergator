 - Support for multilabel and final
 - Integration for HiperGator
 - Integration for game
 - Accuracy Part II (Since this is really a multi-label classification problem that is being treated as a regression problem, please report the accuracy of the multi-label regressor as if it were a classifier, by rounding the output of each regression output to either 0 or 1 and comparing with the testing data)
Must write up:
 - Classifier and Regression Analysis (see bolded section)
